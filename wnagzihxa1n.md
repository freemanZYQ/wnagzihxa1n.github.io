It's a great honor for me to introduce myself to you. My name is wnagzihxa1n, you can call me "big potato" and many friends call me that.In 2013, I was admitted to School of college, I majored in Computer Science. I joined the School ACM Team and trained myself hard. Two years later, my algorithm skills stronger than others.After I hava good C++/Java Programming skills,  I found Android Security was interesting, so I learned knowledge hard again. I focus on Browser Security now and I am going to study Computer Science deeply in Singapore. You can send emails to contact me. Thank you.
